initially we have a test.git with master
git branch dev master


now we have dev master branches
The full steps is
1. modify dev branch
2. add commit push dev
3. git branch release/v1.6 dev
4. add commit push release/v1.6
5. modify dev file and add commit push
6. git checkout release/v1.6
7. git merge dev  (u will show the result commit to release/v1.6 branch)
8. git commit push release/v1.6

delete branch
git branch -D branch_name (Local)
git push origin :heads/branch_name (Remote)
